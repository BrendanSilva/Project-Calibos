# Project-Calibos
The Project Calibos is based on more than thirty lists from reliable and reputable sources. The original database contains approximately three million and two hundred thousand untrusted domains. This large database is, with the use of wildcards, drastically reduced to make the blacklist smaller and more efficient.

This blacklist is an 'all-in-one' that blocks: ads, spam, phishing, malware, trackers, gambling, pornography, pedophilia, analytics, fake news, pop-up windows, social media content, browser-based miners, cookie banners and other annoyances.

Before the release of the version 2.0, the original database will contain more than seven million untrusted domains. Analyzing and verifying data from large databases takes a long time to process, so this list is not updated daily.

If you are using a VPN-structured ad blocker, do not use this list in conjunction with other lists. Make sure that your ad blocker supports the use of wildcards (*.domain).
